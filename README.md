# Tool-parameter-updater-for-Fusion-360
This is made for updating tool infromation from Haimer UNO Autofocus to Fusion 360 software, so the Fusion can have the most fresh information from the tools. It reads the infromation from CSV file and then places the information on correct spots to another CSV file, which will be imported to Fusion 360 software.
